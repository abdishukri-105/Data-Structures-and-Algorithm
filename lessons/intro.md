- Understand the Time and Space complexity of some array methods.
- Create a simple search algorithm and calculate its Time and Space complexity.


## DEFINATIONS
- `Algorithm:`  Set of instructions for solving a problem or accomplishing a task.
 - `Problem Solving:` The process of finding solutions to difficult or complex issues.
 - `Time complexity` of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.
- `Space complexity` of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space or memory taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.
- `Big O notation` is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.


### CONSTANT TIME ~ O(1)

A constant time algorithm is one that has the same running time regardless of the size of the input.

`Example: Accessing specific element in an array using an index.`

### LINEAR TIME ~ O(n)

A linear time algorithm is one that as the amount of data increases, the running time increases by the same amount

`Example: Printing every item in an array.`

### LOGARITHMIC TIME ~ O(log n)

An algorithm that can repeatedly drop half of the required comparisons will have logarithmic time complexity

`Example: Searching for a value in a sorted array.`
